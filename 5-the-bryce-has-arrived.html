            <h1>Chiang Mai Trekking</h1>
             <h2>The day before Bryce arrived in Bankok, Thailand, Jacob and I took a (much nicer than the trip up but at oddly the same price) sleeping car train from Chiang Mai to Bangkok. Getting to the guest house we were to meet Bryce at was eventfull but eventually successful. After walking a ways from the train station to obtain a taxi that wouldn't quote us a hilariously inflated price, we caught a cab. Taxi drivers tend to very confidently assure you that they know where the place is you want to go, but most of them have no idea how to even read a map. This guy stopped multiple times to ask us for directions, drove in at least one loop, and couldn't understand my concerned suggestions that we were going <i>away</i> from our desination before he dropped us off in the wrong place and (successfully) asked if he could keep the change. Without a cell phone data plan, it was a bit hard to find our way to the guest house, but we eventually, eventually made it. 
             <br><br>
             A few hours of lazily dozing in our room later, we heard a knock on the door. The Bryce, glorious and forever more-informed-in-the-ways-of-travel third wheel to our traveling adventure, had arrived! And we had survived the two weeks without him!
             <br><br>
             We had a few days to burn before flying to Indonesia, so we decided to take a short trip to Ayutthaya, a city about 40 miles north of Bangkok. In about 1700, Ayutthaya was one of the largest cities in the world, with a population of around one million. But then the Burmese sacked it and the city now houses some pretty cool ruins and about a twentieth as many people.

             A few hours of lazily dozing in our room later, we heard a knock on the door. The Bryce, glorious and forever more-informed-in-the-ways-of-travel third wheel to our traveling adventure, had arrived! And we had survived the two weeks without him!
             <br><br>
             Our plan was to stay one night in our Bangkok guest house, and leave the next morning to catch a bus to southern Thailand, in order to catch a flight to Kuala Lumpur, Malasia, where we'd then fly to Indonesia. Oh how the hopes and dreams of men crash and die.
             <br><br>
             Right as we were pulling up to the bus station from our thirty minute taxi ride, some how, some way, the conversation turned to my travel purse, which Jacob suddenly remembered ... he had hidden in the curtains of our hotel room. No maid or theif found it, but neither, unfortunately, had we. The taxi driver got pretty confused when we asked him to turn right back around and take us home, but he eventually got the - to me - hilarious message. 
             <br><br>
             So we missed our flight. But it's gotta happen at least once, right? Right? Meh, it was cheap, and definitely entertaining. Instead, we booked a direct flight from Bangkok to Kuala Lumpur and were there in a few days. About at this time, Jacob and I decided it now would be a great time to get sick. So with sleepy eyes and sore throats we tried to sleep on the Kuala Lumpur airport floor (the wise Bryce brought a blow up travel mattress with him), and sipped sweet tea from one of the airport restaurants. 
             <br><br>
             Drearily, we then flew to Palembang, Indonesia and stayed there for a day before flying on to Banka. Palembang was dreadful - huge fires meant that the air there was so thick with smoke visibility was closer to snorkeling than to everyday life. The prices were high, the streets crowded with grey trash and buildings, and the food bad. I hadn't managed to sleep at all at the airport, so tried to sleep at our hotel and not concentrate on the lack of running water or toilet paper (you really need at least one for #2 folks). Banka, however, was much nicer.
             <br><br>
             We were met at the airport by two friendly couchsurfers travel Sensei Bryce had connected with online. Supon and Kiki seemed exicted to show us around and didn't mind that Jacob and I were sick (we told them earlier in case they dind't want to get infected).
